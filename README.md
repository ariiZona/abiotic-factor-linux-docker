# READ FIRST
This is a dirty fix for those who could never connect to their server with the original image.
- Docker network is set in `host` mode
- Has an option to remove the game files each time you start the container

Setup is the same as usual.

# Abiotic Factor Linux Docker
For operating a dedicated server in Docker in order to use it under Linux.
The container uses Wine to run the server under Linux. 

## Setup
1. Create a new empty directory in any location with enough storage space.
2. Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and copy the content of [`docker-compose.yml.example`](docker-compose.yml.example) into it.
3. In the `docker-compose.yml` file, the environment variables `ServerPassword` and `SteamServerName` should be adjusted.
4. Setup and start via docker-compose by running the command `docker-compose up -d`.
    * This will run the server in the background and autostart it whenever the docker daemon starts. If you do not want this, remove `-d` from the command above.
    * This will download the Dedicated Server binaries and game files to the `gamefiles` directory.
    * Persistent save file data will be written to the `data` directory.

## Update
There are two ways to update the game server:

1. By setting the `AutoUpdate` environment variable to `true`. This checks for updates every time the container is started.
2. By deleting the `gamefiles` directory while the server is turned off.

### Updating the container
Sometimes, changes to this container image are necessary. To apply these:

1. Merge the content of `docker-compose.yml` with any changes made from [`docker-compose.yml.example`](docker-compose.yml.example).
2. Run `docker-compose pull` to download an updated version of the container image.

## Configuration
An example configuration for docker-compose can be found in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
In addition to the default settings, which can be set via the environment variables, further arguments can be specified via the `AdditionalArgs` environment variable.

Possible launch parameters and further information on the dedicated servers for Abiotic Factor can be found [here](https://github.com/DFJacob/AbioticFactorDedicatedServer/wiki/Technical-%E2%80%90-Launch-Parameters).
